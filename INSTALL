I - Overview

  BackupAW is backuping software for helping caretaker or citizen to manage their builds.
  It use wxWidget and ActiveWorlds SDK,so it can be build on linux and windows , in the limit of
  the ActiveWorlds SDK in fact.
  
  BackupAW use the unicode build of wxwidget to support internationalization and
  skip windows/linux char problems between ISO and UTF8

II - Build under Linux
  1 - Prerequested
    These devel package are needed to build all requested:
	subversion
	gtk+2.0
	zip
	make
	automake
	autoconf
	m4
	gettext
	libtool
	intltool
	gcc-c++
	libstdc++-devel
	wxgtk2.8
	libwxgtk2.8
	libwxgtk2.8-devel
	upx
    
    a - wxWidget 2.8
      You can use your devel package of wxwidget of your distribution to build Code::Blocks and 
      BackupAw but I council you to make your own libs from wxGTK after have installed the distrib devel
      package with this method:

        First Get the gz tarball of laste released 2.8 wxGTK on
        http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/#latest_stable
        at this hour, the version is 2.8.7
        on consol in user mode
        $ wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxGTK-2.8.7.tar.gz
        $ tar -zxf wxGTK-2.8.7.tar.gz
        $ cd wxGTK-2.8.7
        $ mkdir build_unicode_shared_monolithic
        $ cd build_unicode_shared_monolithic/
        $ ../configure --prefix=/usr --enable-unicode --enable-monolithic --enable-shared
        
        If configure stop with error missing lib, get it from your devel distribution package
        (example on mandriva : urpmi gtk2-devel)
        Try again the configure command and when it success :
        
        $ make
        
        This can take a few time, take a coffee...
        
        switch to root and type:
        
        $ su
        # make install
        
        return to simple user
        # exit
        
        test if the wxGTK are installed correctly by typing:
        
        $ wx-config --libs --unicode=yes --static=no --debug=no
        this should respond: -pthread   -lwx_gtk2u-2.8

    b - Code::blocks nighly build
      
      You need to install subversion package (svn)
      
      go on http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,20.0.html and note wich version is out
      at time this is the 4893
      
      so go on consol on simple user:
      $ mkdir codeblocks
      $ svn checkout --revision 4893 svn://svn.berlios.de/codeblocks/trunk codeblocks
      $ cd codeblocks
      $ ./bootstrap
      $ aclocal
      $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
      $ make
      $ su
      # make install
      # exit
      
      Test the good installation of code::blocks
      
      $ codeblocks
      
      this should launch the code::blocks  IDE

    c - ActiveWorlds SDK 3.6
    
      Get the Linux Andras SDK build 41 gz tarball from his website :
      http://www.andras.net/linuxsdk.html
      
      $ mkdir awsdklnx41
      $ cd awsdklnx41
      $ tar -zxf ../awsdklnx41.1.tar.gz
      $ cd awsdklnx41
      
      now, convert the static lib to shared one :
      
      $ ar -x libaw_sdk.a
      $ gcc -shared *.o -o libaw_sdk.36.so
      $ su
      # cp libaw_sdk.36.so /usr/lib
      # cp aw.h /usr/include/aw41.h
      # exit
    
    d - ActiveWorlds SDK 4.1
    
      Get the linux ActiveWorlds SDK for 4.1 at:
      $ cd ~
      $ wget http://objects.activeworlds.com/downloads/awsdk66.tar.gz
      $ mkdir awsdklnx66
      $ cd awsdklnx66
      $ tar -zxf ../awsdk66.tar.gz
      $ su
      # cp Aw.h /usr/include/aw66.h
      # cp libaw_sdk.41.so.66 /usr/lib
      # /sbin/ldconfig
      # exit

  2 - Build for 3.6

    in console , go to backupaw folder 
    $ codeblocks --build --target=Linux36 backupaw.cbp
    $ cd linux36
    $ ./backupaw
    
  3 - Build for 4.1
  
    in console , go to backupaw folder 
    $ codeblocks --build --target=Linux41 backupaw.cbp
    $ cd linux41
    $ ./backupaw

III - Build under Windows
  1 - Prerequested
    a - Mingw and make addition
    b - wxWidgets 2.8
    c - Code::Blocks Nighly build
    d - ActiveWorlds SDK for 3.6
    e - ActiveWorlds SDK for 4.1
	f - ActiveWorlds SDK for 4.2
  2 - Choose your build
  3 - make NSIS package
  
IV - Take place to backupaw project
